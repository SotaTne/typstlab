It is designed to be an alternative both to advanced tools\nlike LaTeX and simpler tools like Word and Google Docs. Our goal with Typst is\nto build a typesetting tool that is highly capable <em>and</em> a pleasure to use.</p>\n<p>This documentation is split into two parts: A beginner-friendly tutorial that\nintroduces Typst through a practical use case and a comprehensive reference that\nexplains all of Typst's concepts and features.</p>\n<p>We also invite you to join the community we're building around Typst. Typst is\nstill a very young project, so your feedback is more than valuable.</p>"
